# Nic Vetter - 9/7/2023 - American Football - datafun-06-projects link: https://github.com/VetterNic/datafun-06-projects

# Objectives:
1. Perform a guided exploratory data analysis project.
2. Conduct a unique data analysis exploration.

# Goals of Module 6 - projects

This module requires the skills learned in previous chapters. 

The first is a guided exploratory data project that focuses on diamonds.csv and is based on in Exercise 9.16 beginning on page 352 of the text. 

The second is a project showcasing the knowledge that I have gained within the domain of American Football. More Specifically, I will be using an NFL Draft data set to showcase my skills that I have developed over the past 6 weeks. 

# This read.me includes instructions with the exact commands to: 

## Create your virtual environment 
    - Open the terminal in VS Code. (View / Terminal)
    - Run the following command to create a virtual environment for this project:
    - python -m venv .venv
    - Verify that a new .venv folder was created. It may take a while for the command to complete.

ðŸš€ Rocket Tip: When VS Code Python Extension offers to select the Environment, say Yes.

## Activate the Virtual Environment
Wait for the creation to finish, then activate the virtual environment:

    - For PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate
    - For macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/
ðŸš€ Rocket Tip: Notice the terminal changes to reflect the active virtual environment.

## Install all required external dependencies.
Install additional project dependencies into the active virtual environment. The packages ipykernel and jupyterlab are required to run a notebook. The packages pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are used to work with data and charts.

    - python -m pip install --upgrade pip ipykernel jupyterlab
    - python -m pip install --upgrade pandas matplotlib seaborn
    - python -m pip install --upgrade voila

Alternatively, you can install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

    - python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Note: The --upgrade parameter gets the latest version of each package.
